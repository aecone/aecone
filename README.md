🎯 **Featured Project: [SwipeConnect](https://github.com/aecone/SwipeConnect)**

A mobile mentorship app designed to make finding mentors and mentees effortless for Rutgers students. The platform replaces scattered, club-specific pairing systems with a unified, swipe-based experience where students can connect through shared majors, interests, and career goals. By combining personalized profiles, real-time messaging, and smart filtering, SwipeConnect transforms campus networking into a simple and engaging process.

**My Accomplishments:**

* **Backend & Infrastructure:**
  * Built Flask APIs for creating, editing, and filtering user profiles with Firebase Firestore subcollections for structured data.
  * Deployed and configured the backend on **Render**, resolved Firebase credential issues, and integrated **Better Stack** for real-time logging and monitoring.
* **Frontend Integration & State Management:**
  * Enhanced the multi-step profile creation flow with navigation, state persistence, and bug fixes that improved reliability.
  * Refactored front-end utilities, removed unused files, and improved modularity for easier maintenance.
* **Collaboration & Tooling:**
  * Set up the project repository, maintained endpoint documentation, and conducted endpoint testing with **Postman**.
  * Coordinated sprint progress through **Jira** and **Confluence**, improving organization and visibility.
* **Key Learnings:**
  * Gained experience in mobile full-stack integration, NoSQL data modeling, and API debugging.
  * Strengthened communication and agile workflow habits through iterative sprint feedback.
